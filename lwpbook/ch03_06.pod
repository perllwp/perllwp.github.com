=head1 3.6. LWP Classes: Behind the Scenes

To get data off the Web with LWP, you really only need to know about
LWP::UserAgent objects and HTTP::Response objects (although a
rudimentary knowledge of the URI class and the HTTP::Cookies class can
help too). But behind the scenes, there are dozens and dozens of
classes that you generally don't need to know about, but that are still
busily doing their work. Most of them are documented in the LWP manual
pages, and you may see them mentioned in the documentation for the
modules about which you I<do> need to know. For completeness, they are
listed in Appendix A, "LWP Modules".
