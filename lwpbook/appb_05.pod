=head1 B.5. 500s: Server Errors

If an LWP request gets any of these 500-series codes,
C<$response-E<gt>is_error> will be true, as it will be for any of the
400-series codes. For all other status codes,
C<$response-E<gt>is_error> will be false.

Note that at the time of this writing, the "500 Internal Server Error"
code is also used by LWP to signal some error conditions where the
remote server can't even be contacted, such as when there's a DNS
failure or a TCP/IP connection error.

 500 Internal Server Error
 501 Not Implemented
 502 Bad Gateway
 503 Service Unavailable
 504 Gateway Timeout
 505 HTTP Version Not Supported
