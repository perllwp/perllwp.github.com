=head1 Appendix D. Language Tags

Language tags are a system defined in RFC 3066, which is used in
various Internet protocols and formats, including HTML, HTTP, and XML.
For example, an HTTP request often has an C<Accept-Language> header, an
HTTP response can have a C<Content-Language> header, and any HTML
element can have a C<lang="en-US"> or (in XML and XHTML) an
C<xml:lang="en-US"> attribute to indicate that its content is in that
language.

There are I<many> more language tags than are presented here; for the
full list, see documentation for the Perl module I18N::LangTags::List.
This appendix lists major languages, in alphabetical order by their
English names.

Note: the core Perl module I18N::LangTags::List contains (as data table
and as documentation you can read now
(http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/I18N-LangTags/lib/I18N/LangTags/List.pm))
a much more complete list. I had to keep the list below short for sake
of brevity of the book.)

One of my more, uh, colicky consulting editors, had a some sort of fit
of loud officiousness when he saw the above list. I<What's this
Konkani? and Tee-loo-goo?! I've never heard of these languages! Who put
this list together, who decided what got on this list?!> etc etc.

I replied, basically: I<I> put the list together (this being my book,
and welcome to it), and while I decidedly will not walk you down the
list explaining how each line satisfies one or more exacting criterion,
FYI, it's basically a combination of:

=over

=item * languages with huge numbers of speakers (Chinese, Spanish,
Arabic)

=item * the four big languages of New World (English, Spanish,
Portuguese, and French)

=item * the official languages of every European country

=item * the official languages of India (by some criterion I've now
forgottenE<mdash> this is a complicated and ever-changing issue
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_languages_of_India))

=item * the official languages of other important Eurasian countries
(Korean, Thai, Farsi, Urdu)

=item * plus whatever I felt like (Hawaiian, Hebrew, Basque, Ancient
Greek)

=item * minus whatever I felt like (sorry, Flemish, Walloon, Romansh,
and Luxembourgish, euro-official though you may be)

=back

...and (I continued, to the colicky consulting editor), Konkani has
more speakers than Danish (which you've heard of), and Telugu has more
speakers than German (which you've heard of, and heard!), so failing to
have ever heard of them is, well, just too bad for you.
